                            <p>Don't just think it, Pink It. Thinking about a cause and doing something about it are two completely different things. By donating to and supporting breast cancer we are showing the millions who fight this disease that we care. There are many ways that we can show our support but for those fashion savvy individuals adding pink strands to their hair might be your niche.</p>
                            <p>This year, Donna Bella will be giving back in three ways:</p>
                            <p>1 - From September 1st through October 31st, all of our pink hair will be available at a 10% discount. And we will donate 50% of our proceeds from pink hair sales to the <a href="nbcf.php">National Breast Cancer Foundation</a>.</p>
                            <p align="center"><a href="http://www.donnabellahair.com/hair-extensions/catalog/pink-strands-for-the-cause.html" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://wpc.aaf7.edgecastcdn.net/00AAF7/psftc/images/purchase.png" alt="Purchase Pink Hair" /></a></p>
                            <p>2 - Donna Bella will work with participating salons throughout the United States to give back even more. Participating salons will install pink strands for $10 and donate proceeds to the <a href="nbcf.php">National Breast Cancer Foundation</a>.</p>
                            <p align="center"><a href="what_you_can_do.php"><img src="http://wpc.aaf7.edgecastcdn.net/00AAF7/psftc/images/participate.png" alt="Become a Participating Salon" /></a></p>
                            <p>3 - Donna Bella will also be hosting and participating in several breast cancer awareness events across the country.</p>
