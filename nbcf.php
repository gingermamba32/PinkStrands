                            <p>The National Breast Cancer Foundation was started by Janelle Hail, a survivor of breast cancer, in 1991. The foundation raises funds for awareness, early detection, and research. Their main goal is to bring awareness not just to those suffering from breast cancer but to friends and family members as well. By building a more knowledgeable community we can each have a role in helping to save lives. The quicker you find help for breast cancer the better your chances are at living a long and healthy life. </p>
                            <p>One of the best things you can do for yourself, and the women in your life, is to become educated. By doing regular self tests you can find early signs of breast cancer. If you think you have a possible sign get it looked at right away, the worst thing you can do is wait. The earlier you can catch it, the earlier you can be treated which gives you the best chance of becoming a survivor. </p>
                            <p>By joining together to spread hope we become a more united people. Show your support by taking a stand today and do something, even if the only thing you can do is share hope. </p>
